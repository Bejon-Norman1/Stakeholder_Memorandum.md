# Stakeholder Memorandum

**TO:** IT Manager, stakeholders  
**FROM:**  Bejon Norman  
**DATE:**  7/11/2023  
**SUBJECT:** Internal IT Audit Findings and Recommendations

Dear Colleagues,

I would like to share with you the findings and recommendations resulting from the internal audit conducted for Botium Toys. Please review the following information regarding the audit scope, goals, critical findings, summary, and recommendations.

## Scope

- The audit focuses on the following systems: accounting, endpoint detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, and SIEM tool. These systems will be evaluated for current user permissions, implemented controls, procedures, and protocols.

- The objective is to ensure that current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols align with PCI DSS and GDPR compliance requirements.

- The audit will account for both hardware and system access.

## Goals
- Adhere to the NIST CSF.
- Establish a better process for system compliance.
- Fortify system controls.
- Implement the concept of least permissions for user credential management.
- Establish policies and procedures, including playbooks.
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Critical Findings (Immediate Action Required)
- Multiple controls need to be developed and implemented, including:
  - Control of Least Privilege and Separation of Duties.
  - Disaster recovery plans.
  - Password, access control, and account management policies, including the implementation of a password management system.
  - Encryption for secure website transactions.
  - IDS implementation.
  - Regular backups.
  - Antivirus (AV) software.
  - Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance.
  - Lock implementation.
  - Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention for legacy systems.
  - Fire detection and prevention systems.
- Develop and implement policies to meet PCI DSS and GDPR compliance requirements.
- Develop and implement policies to align with SOC1 and SOC2 guidance regarding user access policies and overall data safety.

## Findings (Address in Due Course)
- The following controls should be implemented when possible:
  - Time-controlled safe.
  - Adequate lighting.
  - Locking cabinets.
  - Signage indicating alarm service provider.

## Summary/Recommendations
It is recommended to promptly address the critical findings related to compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR, as Botium Toys accepts online payments globally, including the E.U. To achieve the goal of least permissions, utilize SOC1 and SOC2 guidance for developing appropriate policies and procedures regarding user access and overall data safety. Disaster recovery plans and backups are critical for business continuity. Integration of IDS and AV software will enhance risk identification and mitigation, particularly for legacy systems requiring manual monitoring and intervention. Implementing locks and CCTV will further secure physical assets. While not immediately necessary, consider encryption, time-controlled safe, adequate lighting, locking cabinets, fire detection and prevention systems, and signage indicating alarm service provider to enhance overall security.

Thank you for your attention to these findings and recommendations. If you have any questions or require further clarification, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,

Bejon Norman
